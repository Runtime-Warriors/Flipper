## Overview

### Description

This is a photo editing app where users will either upload an existing photo or take a photo daily in real time and edit it on the spot.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Entertainment, Social

- **Mobile:** This is a unique application because it allows users to upload and edit their photos quickly using their mobile device no matter when or where they are.


- **Story:** This application will allow users to get their desired photo edited. My peers would think it is different because it is not your regular photos app on your phone. Additionally, a lot of people like when their photos are edited compared to the usual format.

- **Market:** It can be used by a huge group of users with no particluar age range, being that mostly everyone uses their photo function on their phone. Age 10+. It has value to users who prefer their pictures being edited and who think it would be fun to edit photos as well. 

- **Habit:** The average usage of the app depends on how frequently a user takes selfies (or photos of themselves) and wants to edit. It can be both addictive and habit-forming. 

- **Scope:** It wont be too difficult to create, however user features can be implented to enhance the interactive nature of the application and make it more versatile than just editing for one use.
