## The Top Five - Evaluation
1. *Daily photo*
    - **Mobile:** Mobile is needed because users will need the camera to take a picture daily. Location services will also be needed to map each picture to a location.   
    - **Category:** Social, Lifestyle
    - **Story:** Creates an intimate timeline for users to track their growth and progress as well as the progress of others.
    - **Market:** Everyone from all ages and backgrounds can benefit from this app. The first audience for this app would be teenagers and college students because they go through big changes within a short amount of time.
    - **Habit:** This app will help users form a habit of taking a picture daily. The average user would open this app at least once a day. 
    - **Scope:** The challenges for this app would be learning how to access the camera in android studio but it is possible to complete this by the end of the semester.

3. *Budget manager system* - Kenthia 
    - **Mobile:** As you make purchases, during or at the end of the day, you are able to enter how much money you spent immediately without the annoyance of remembering to tally everything at the end of the month.

    - **Category:** Lifestyle

    - **Story:** Peers will respond well to this product , because it can help you easily maintain your budget in a very easy and concise way, managing your finances all in one place.

    - **Market:** The unique market can be college students, or even high school students who are still learning how to budget and manage their money and their parents want to give them the freedom to do so.

    - **Habit:** This is more of a habit-forming app as users will have to intentionally open the app and create the habit around rememberring to enter the values for how much they spent on a given day/week.

    - **Scope:** The scope of this app is well formed to have a section to put the total you spent on a given day that you input , whereby at the end of the week you can see how much you spent in week and so manage your budget. You can also add in how well you feel you are doing towards your budgeting goal etc.

5. *FirstMatch* - Kenthia
    - **Mobile:** First Watch allows the user to update their preferences anytime and anywhere and also play matching games questions in real-time to make new matches as well.


    - **Category:** Social

    - **Story:** Users can now meet their match made in heaven, but it's more than a swipe on a tinder app. It's actually speed dating, one question, and then you get a match ! The gamification will have you on your feet on who you can match with on any given day.

    - **Market:** The unique market will be bachelors, specifically those interested in marriage , 21+

    - **Habit:** The app is a mix of habit-forming and addictive as the questions that you are asked make you want to answer over and over for a new match, especially because you only get one match a day. If your matches aren't successful, the user can make it a habit to check back as often as they like to see if new matches can be found, or who their new match is for the next day.

    - **Scope:** The most challenging part of the app would actually be the range of questions i.e the getting to know each other, that can be pulled from a database as those questions of the day would have to change so the person can get a new match. A stripped down version is still an interesting build because even with one question, you never know who has the same answer as you to get a potential match.


4. *Flipper*
    - **Mobile:** This is a unique application because it allows users to edit their photos quickly using their mobile device.
    - **Category:** Social? Editing?
    
    - **Story:** How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
 This application will allow users to get their desired photo mirrored. My peers would respond positivly. This is because a lot of people like to when their photos are flipped compared to the usual format.
    - **Market:** It can be used by a huge group of users with no particluar age range being that mostly everyone uses their photo function on their phone. Age +10
It has value to users who prefer their pictures being flipped.

    - **Habit:** The average usage of the app depends on how frequently a user takes selfies (or photos of themselves) and wants to edit.
The user uses this app to create rather than consume information.
    - **Scope:** It wont be too difficult to create.  a stripped-down version of this app still interesting to build?
How clearly defined is the product you want to build? The app function itself is very straightfoward, only have one function.
5. *New music finder*
    - **Mobile:** This application is unique because it serves one purpose of exposing new music to avid music listeners. It is needed because often times music listeners get bored with their current playlist and need to songs to add.

    - **Category:** Lifestyle
    - **Story:** 
This application finds new music for users to listen to. Using the most current trendy music (Billboard top 100â€¦ etc) the user will be randomly given a song from the popular list. My peers would resspond positevly, being that they enjoy finding new music to listen to.
    - **Market:** The user base scales to all potential new music listeners. Not necessarily a niche group, but it has a lot of potnential value. 

    - **Habit:**  I say users will use this app about once or twice a month to get updated on new music. Rather than creating, this app is used for information consumption with the info being new popular music.
    - **Scope:** We would have to find a database of music that is updated with the most recent popular songs of that time frame, that would be the most difficult part for me.
Making a mock up would be interesting for this app, but I think the idea itself is very defined.


## The Final Decision
:bulb: **Flipper**
